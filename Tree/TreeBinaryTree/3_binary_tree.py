Binary Tree
- Binary trees are the data structure in which each node has at most two children, often referred to as the left and right children
- Binary tree is a family of data structure (BTS, Heap tree, AVL, Red Black Trees, Syntax Trees).
- Binary trees are a prerequisite for mode advanced trees like BTS, AVL, Red Black Trees
- Huffman Coding problem, heap priority problem and expression parsing problems can be solved efficiently using binary trees,

Types of Binary Tree
- Full Binary Tree (each node have two children but not same level mendatory)
- Perfect Binary Tree (each node two children and same level)
- Complete Binary Tree (Complete without last level)
- Balanced Binary Tree (All leaf node has same depth)

Representaion of Binary Tree
- Linked List
- Python List (array)
